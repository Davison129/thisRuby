In average_rating method, I thought it calculated too much within that method.
So I split it into two different methods and called the new method from within average_rating.
I also changed @player.size to size for more cohesion.

In the player class in the expected_score_per_round method, I found it lacked cohesion.
So I split it into two methods with average_rating_minus_players.

In the player class in the new_rating method, I found it lacked cohesion.
So I split it into two methods with opponent_size.
